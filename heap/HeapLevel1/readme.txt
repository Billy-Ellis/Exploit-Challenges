Welcome to HeapLevel1, created by Billy Ellis @bellis1000!

The objective of this challenge is to understand the basics of heap overflow vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. There are a wide variety of different kinds of heap overflow exploits out there, but this is just one specific example involving overwriting data from one object stored on the heap to another.

Try executing a shell command of your choice by supplying a malicious string ;)
