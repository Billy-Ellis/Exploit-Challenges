HeapLevel3

////////////

This ARM exploit exercise introduces yet another type of heap-related vulnerability - double free()! You will notice that the program runs in a similar way to HeapLevel2 (previous level), but this time there is no UAF present. You must use the double free() bug to give you a UAF condition which you can then exploit!

Enjoy!
