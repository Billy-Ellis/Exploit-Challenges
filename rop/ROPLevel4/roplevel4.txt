ROPLevel4 created by Billy Ellis (@bellis1000)

This goal of this exploit exercise is to call the secret() function by exploiting a classic stack buffer overflow. Sounds simple? Yes... but this level has ASLR enabled.

ASLR randomises the address space of the program every time it is run. Using an address found from a static analysis of the binary will not be enough to complete this challenge as the address of secret() will change each time you execute the program.

To assist you, ROPLevel4 will give you an info leak so you don't have to think about discovering your own. It will leak the address of a string stored in the binary, but will not tell you the address of secret().
