ROPLevel6 for ARM64 by @bellis1000
/////////////////////

This is a 64-bit version of ROPLevel6.

The aim is to create a fake ROP stack on the heap with any gadgets you may require, then use a stack pivot gadget to pivot to this fake stack.

The actual core of the ROP chain must allow you to call secret() with the correct code (argument) passed to it.

You'll need to write a separate exploit script/C program to deal with ASLR and gadget offsets etc

Enjoy! :)
